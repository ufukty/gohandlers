# ☝️ Partial disabling

For the HTTP handlers which defining request and response structure don't make sense, Gohandlers can be directed to **exclude** them from code generation processes. Depending on needs, the handler can be completely ignored by Gohandlers or just included in `.ListHandlers()` function/methods generated by `list` command.

## 🛑 Listing only

```go
// gh:list
func MyHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
```

Adding a doc-comment as `gh:list` would make code generation processes other than `list` to ignore the handler and its binding types. The handler will be included in the `.ListHandlers()` function/methods, still can be registered to the router.

## ⛔️ Ignore

```go
// gh:ignore
func MyHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
```

Adding a doc-comment as `gh:ignore` would make Gohandlers to completely ignore the handler. Therefore Gohandler will be disabled for that handler. Even the `.ListHandlers()` function/methods won't mention that handler.

## 🤔 When to disable?

Gohandlers doesn't support those specialties you might need from time to time:

-   Multipart requests
-   Streaming

For handlers with any of the above, it might be wise to write the specific handler body manually.

Also —due to their sizes— creating binding types for file upload/download handlers might not make sense since binding types will hold another copy of the HTTP data, in-memory.
