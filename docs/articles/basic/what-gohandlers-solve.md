# 🤔 What Gohandlers Solve?

Writing HTTP APIs in Go is enjoyable due to Go’s simplicity, performance, and strong type system. However, as your project grows, managing repetitive boilerplate code quickly becomes a significant pain point. Handlers start looking similar, with the same repeated parsing logic, validation patterns, and response serialization. Even minor changes, like adding a new field or parameter, often require tedious updates across multiple files.

**gohandlers** addresses these issues directly, streamlining your development process and letting you focus purely on your core logic. Let’s explore precisely what problems gohandlers solves, and why it matters.

## 🧩 The Problem: Repetitive Boilerplate Code

In typical Go HTTP APIs, each handler often looks like this:

```go
func CreatePet(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  var req CreatePetRequest

  // Parse JSON body
  if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&req); err != nil {
    http.Error(w, "invalid request body", http.StatusBadRequest)
    return
  }

  // Manual validation
  if req.Name == "" {
    http.Error(w, "name required", http.StatusBadRequest)
    return
  }

  // Business logic
  id, err := store.Create(req.Name, req.Tag)
  if err != nil {
    http.Error(w, "internal error", http.StatusInternalServerError)
    return
  }

  // Response serialization
  resp := struct{ ID string }{ID: id}
  w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
  if err := json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(resp); err != nil {
    http.Error(w, "serialization error", http.StatusInternalServerError)
  }
}
```

Almost every handler repeats similar logic:

-   JSON parsing and error handling
-   Validation checks
-   Response serialization and content-type headers
-   Repetitive HTTP status codes and error management

Multiply this by dozens or even hundreds of handlers, and your codebase becomes difficult to maintain, tedious to extend, and prone to inconsistencies.

## ⚠️ The Hidden Costs of Manual Boilerplate

Manually written boilerplate isn’t just tedious—it leads to real problems:

-   **Maintenance overhead:** Every change (e.g., adding fields) means manual updates in multiple handlers.
-   **Error-prone:** Inconsistent validation, serialization, or parsing can cause bugs.
-   **Reduced readability:** Repetitive code obscures business logic.
-   **Difficult onboarding:** New developers must understand the repetitive patterns in each handler.

## 🚀 How gohandlers Solves This Problem

**gohandlers** solves this problem by automatically generating the tedious parts of your HTTP handlers. It leverages Go structs and struct tags as a **single source of truth**, automatically producing:

-   **Request parsing logic:** Automatically handles JSON, route params, queries, and form data.
-   **Validation methods:** Generates per-field validation, making errors clear and consistent.
-   **Response serialization:** Consistently serializes your response structs.
-   **Handler registration:** Automatically generates route-to-handler mappings.
-   **Client and mocks:** Provides type-safe client libraries and mock implementations for testing.

Instead of repetitive handler code, you simply write clear, concise Go structs:

```go
type CreatePetRequest struct {
  Name string `json:"name"`
  Tag  string `json:"tag"`
}

type CreatePetResponse struct {
  ID string `json:"id"`
}
```

And your handler becomes streamlined and focused:

```go
func (p *Pets) CreatePet(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  req := &CreatePetRequest{}
  if err := req.Parse(r); err != nil {
    http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
    return
  }

  if errs := req.Validate(); len(errs) > 0 {
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnprocessableEntity)
    json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(errs)
    return
  }

  id, err := p.store.Create(req.Name, req.Tag)
  if err != nil {
    http.Error(w, "internal error", http.StatusInternalServerError)
    return
  }

  resp := &CreatePetResponse{ID: id}
  if err := resp.Write(w); err != nil {
    http.Error(w, "write failed", http.StatusInternalServerError)
  }
}
```

Your handler is clean, readable, and purely focused on the business logic. All repetitive parsing, validation, and serialization is handled automatically.
